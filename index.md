The main goal of this documentation is to give a high level overview of all the Bluejay components. This is especially useful since Bluejay is written in 8051 assembler which is not the most intuitive programming language to read - as is the case with all assembler languages.

You will find a lot of flow charts to visualize what the code does. The ultimate goal is to have it documented in such a way that developers not familiar with 8051 assembler are able to find the part they are looking for, understand it and improve it.
