The main goal of this documentation is to give a high level overview of all the Bluejay components. This is especially useful since Bluejay is written in 8051 assembler which is not the most intuitive programming language to read - as is the case with all assembler languages.

You will find a lot of flow charts to visualize what the code does. The ultimate goal is to have it documented in such a way that developers not familiar with 8051 assembler are able to find the part they are looking for, understand it and improve on it. Throughout the documentation you will also find a couple of primers for a lot of things.
